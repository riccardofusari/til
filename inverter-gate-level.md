The substrate is usually a thick layer of silicon that has to be thickening up for mechanical resistance and robustness. But, the part used for electrical reasons is smaller. In this case is doped of p+. To subdivide the two zone an epitax layer is used.

The N transistor has two doped n+, the drain and source. Then there is an gate-oxide made by a poly-silicon, which is silicon highly doped. That's the gate. 

The P transistor is the opposite configuration, with an n- well underneath.

On the left of the N transistor there is a p+ doped that forms a diode. That's necessary to connect to the metal layer connected to ground (in this case). That is necessary to transfer the correct polarization to the bottom.

We have a lot of layers -> gates, layer of metal, gap, layer of metal, gap, layer of metal and so on. With a lot of layers of metal (around 20 now) it is possible to route all the transistors.

In the middle, to sustain everything we have the silicon dioxide.
