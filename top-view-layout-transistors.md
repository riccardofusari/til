A layout is a top view of the design that defines all the doping and different materials, connection and everything. The top view (layout) is then used for the mask production for fabrication.

From the top view is possible to notice that the W of the NMOS is different from the PMOS ones. We need a different amount of current for the two different transistors.
The holes of PMOS have a lower mobility, so they need a larger current to works.
