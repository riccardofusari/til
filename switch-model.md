# Switch model
The transistors in this level, are considereted just switches. 
If the transistor is on (meaning that a certain voltage is applied to the gate depending on the technology), the switch is on. 
If the transistor is off, the switch is *off*  too.

Related to that easy idea, there is a ton of issues related. A lot of logic families try to address each issue in a different way.

The main logic families of transistors can be subdivided in
##### Combinational
- CMOS 
- Pass transistor
- Pseudo-NMOS
- Differential
- Domino
##### Sequential
- Flip Flop
- TSPC
