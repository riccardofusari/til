# Transmission gates capacitance
A transmission gate typically consists of a p-channel MOSFET (PMOS) and an n-channel MOSFET (NMOS) connected in parallel.

When a control signal, usually referred to as the enable or select signal, is activated, the transmission gate conducts, allowing the digital signal to pass through. This conducting state also introduces parasitic capacitance associated with the transistors.

The PMOS and NMOS transistors in a transmission gate have inherent capacitance between their various terminals, such as the gate, source, and drain. These capacitances arise due to the physical structure and operation of the transistors. When the transmission gate is conducting, these capacitances become part of the overall circuit and can affect its behavior.
