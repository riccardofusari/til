# Pass transistor logic
![](../media/Pasted%20image%2020230525190453.png)

The logic is simple: due to the value of $\alpha$ the signal pass or not.

The problem is the technology that you use:
- NMOS, if IN = '0', the OUT goes to '0' rapidly. If '1', it is really slow!
- PMOS, the complementary of NMOS

To resolve that, transmission gates are used.
