Steps in Design

1. Work out the hardware algorithm and overall strategy
2. Identify and name all the registers (flip-flops)
	- Determine system timing while doing this
	- Which value has to be preserved to next clock cycle
3. Identify the behavior of each "cloud" of combinational logic
4. TRANSLATE design to RTL
5. Verify Design
6. Synthesize Design
