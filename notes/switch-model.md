# Switch model
The transistors in this level, are considered just as switches. 

If the transistor is on (meaning that a certain threshold voltage is applied to the gate in which the value depends from the technology), the switch is on. 

If the transistor is off, the switch is *off*  too.

Starting from that simple idea, there is a ton of issues related to it. A lot of logic families try to address each issue in a different way. 

The main logic families of transistors can be subdivided in

##### Combinational
- [CMOS](cmos.md) 
- [Pass transistor](transmission-gates.md)
- [Pseudo-NMOS](pseudo-nmos-family.md)
- [DCVSL](differential-logic.md) (Differential Cascode Voltage Swing Logic)
- [Domino](domino-logic.md)

##### Sequential
- Flip Flop
- TSPC
