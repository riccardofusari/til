# Switch model
The transistors in this level, are considereted just as switches. 

If the transistor is on (meaning that a certain voltage is applied to the gate depending on the technology), the switch is on. 

If the transistor is off, the switch is *off*  too.

Starting from that simple idea, there is a ton of issues related to it. A lot of logic families try to address each issue in a different way.

The main logic families of transistors can be subdivided in

##### Combinational
- CMOS 
- Pass transistor
- Pseudo-NMOS
- Differential
- Domino

##### Sequential
- Flip Flop
- TSPC
