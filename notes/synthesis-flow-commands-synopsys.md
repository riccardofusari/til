The synthesis process before formal verification and post-synthesis STA and SPA is defined by 6 main steps.
1. [[specify-library-sys]]
2. [[read-design-sys]]
3. [[design-env-sys]]
4. [[set-design-constraints-SDC-sys]]
5. [[optimize-design-sys]]
6. [[save-design-sys]]

Each steps has a group of commands that can be used into the dc_shell through tcl scripts.
