It was used for the pentium 4 adder. It needs a control signal, but is still combinational!

- CK = 0, PMOS on, NMOS off. So the OUT is Vdd no matter what the input is
- CK = 1, PMOS off, NMOS on. So the OUT depend from the N network


###### Pros
- Size smaller
- Lower power consumption due to smaller parasite capacitance
- Faster for the lower parasite capacitance
###### Cons
-
