# Abstraction layers in computer engineering
The innovation in computer technology is made possible thanks to the abstraction layers that allows engineers to focus on less complex problems.

The main abstraction layers are

- Application Software
- [Operating systems](indexes/operating-systems.md)
- Architecture
- Micro architecture 
- [Switch level](switch-model.md)
- Transistor level
- Physics

Each of this layer has it's own abstraction layer inside. Generally, one layer heavily communicate and depends from the near layers.

Nowadays, if you are in the architectural level, you need to know very well also the other levels because they are really correlated.
