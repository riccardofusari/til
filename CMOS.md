The P-network is usually called pull-up (is referenced to power supply)

the N-network is usually called pull-down (is referenced to reference voltage).

The two circuit work in a complementary way.

Usually the CMOS output is always "negated". That means that the normal configurations produce nand or not, due to the P-Network on top. Could be the other way around theoretically right, but problems would be introduced. Indeed, the P-mos is better suited with higher current, so near the power supply. On the other hand, the N-mos is better suited connected to ground.
