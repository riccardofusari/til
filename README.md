# Today I Learned

> Trying to suck less every day

I'm developing a habit of condensing and distilling the things I learn on a daily basis into atomic notes that (hopefully) will be linked together in the future.
By doing this, I hope to create a repository of knowledge that I can look back at it whenever I need to. I find that it helps me to reinforce the concepts that I have learned and also to build upon them as I continue to grow and learn more.

The idea of this “Today I Learned” repository is kindly stolen from blog posts of Josh Branchaud (on GitHub [@jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud)) and swyx ([beautiful article](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)), to whom I extend my gratitude. The concept of “atomic notes” is taken from the Zettelkasten method, very well explained in the book “[How to take Smart Notes](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+take+smart+notes+libro&oq=how+to+take+smart+notes+libro&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30.3615j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)”.

This repository is intended for learning purposes only and does not aim to cover every detail nor to be shared. However, I would be very happy if you find some content useful. Please remember to verify the accuracy of any information you collect :-)
