In digital design, a transmission gate is a type of electronic switch that can control the flow of digital signals. It is commonly used in integrated circuits (ICs) for various purposes, such as multiplexing, signal routing, and level shifting. The transmission gate consists of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors configured in a specific way to allow the passage of digital signals.

If C= '1' both the MOS transistors are in conduction, so B=A and the value will be efficiently reached independently of input value ('1' or '0'). This works because if the input is a 0 the NMOS will conduct most of the current; on the contrary, if the input is a 1, the PMOS will be the conductive one.

They are heavily used for multiplexers, decoders and shifters.
