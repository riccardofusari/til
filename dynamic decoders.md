The pink pmos are connected to the output line. The gates are connected to the ENABLE.
If the ENABLE is 0, the PMOS are activated and so we are pre-charging all the lines: the parasitic capacitance that are present will be pre-charged. This is the pre-charge phase.

A transistor is connected between the pre-charged line and a GND line. The gates are connected to A0. The same for A0 negated in an alternative way.

A similar configuration but a group of two alternate.

How can you scale up?
