In SystemVerilog, the `protected` keyword is used to declare a protected type. A protected type provides a mechanism for creating concurrent access to shared data while ensuring mutual exclusion and synchronization between different processes or threads.

The purpose of a protected variable is to provide controlled access to shared data, ensuring that only one process or thread can access the variable at a time.
