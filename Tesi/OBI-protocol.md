### **Open Bus Interface (OBI)**

The **Open Bus Interface (OBI)** is a key component in your debug module that facilitates communication within the SoC. It provides a standardized, high-speed, and efficient protocol for data exchange between the **debug module** and other SoC components like memory, peripherals, and CPU cores.

### **Purpose of OBI in Your Debug Module**

- **Role**: OBI acts as the final stage in the flow from OpenOCD → JTAG → DMI → OBI.
- **Objective**: Translate DMI requests (e.g., register reads/writes) into memory-mapped transactions that interact with the target SoC resources.
- **Location in Your Design**: The `dm_obi_top` module in your RTL connects the debug module to the SoC via the OBI interface.

| Signal | Width  | Direction       | Purpose                                                                          |
| ------ | ------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| req    | 1      | Master -> Slave | Indicates a request (asserted high to start a transaction).                      |
| addr   | N      | Master -> Slave | Specifies the target address for the transaction.                                |
| we     | 1      | Master -> Slave | Write enable: `0` = Read, `1` = Write.                                           |
| wdata  | M      | Master -> Slave | Data to be written (valid when `we = 1`).                                        |
| be     | 4 or 8 | Master -> Slave | Byte enable: Indicates which bytes in `wdata` are valid.                         |
| gnt    | 1      | Slave -> Master | Grant signal: Acknowledges the request and indicates the slave is processing it. |
| rvalid | 1      | Slave -> Master | Response valid: Indicates the response data is ready for read operations.        |
| rdata  | M      | Slave -> Master | Read data: Contains the value from the requested address.                        |

### **Request-Response Workflow**

1. **Request**:
    
    - The debug module (OBI master) asserts `req` with:
        - `addr`: Target address.
        - `we`: Read (`0`) or Write (`1`).
        - `wdata` (optional): Write data for write operations.
    - The slave monitors these signals.
2. **Grant**:
    
    - The slave asserts `gnt` to acknowledge the request.
3. **Response**:
    
    - For **Read**:
        - The slave asserts `rvalid` and places the result in `rdata`.
    - For **Write**:
        - The transaction is considered complete once the slave asserts `gnt`.

### **Simplified Example**

#### **Debugging a CPU Register Read (`x1`)**

1. **DMI Request**:
    
    - `addr = 0x100`, `we = 0`, `wdata = unused`.
2. **OBI Transaction**:
    
    - `req = 1`: Start the transaction.
    - `addr = 0x100`: Target register address.
    - `we = 0`: Read operation.
3. **Slave Response**:
    
    - `gnt = 1`: Slave acknowledges the request.
    - `rvalid = 1`: Slave provides the result in `rdata`.
    - `rdata = 0xCAFEBABE`: Value of register `x1`.
