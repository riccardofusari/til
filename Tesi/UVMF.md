One of the main features of the framework is to generate code automatically without writing any line of code.
This is done by starting from a yaml file that describes all the features of the block that you want to create and pass this yaml file to a python script that generates the code for you.

A good practice is to try immediately the generated code with the default simulation in order to see if any errors pop up.
